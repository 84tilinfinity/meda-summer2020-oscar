            <h2 id="first-section-title">My Work</h2>
            <p>I am still learning about web development and don't have a large quantity of projects under my belt. I have completed a hobby page detailing what I enjoy doing on a daily basis: making cold brew coffee. This portfolio page is also a project I am completing for my Mission Techies course from MEDA SF. Enjoy my work and feel free to leave any feedback in the "Contact" section if you'd like.</p>
            <p><h2>First Project</h2></p>
            <img src="images/hobby.jpg">
            <p>For my hobby site, I explained what materials you need to make cold brew coffee, as well as step by step instructions on how to make it. It was the first website I made, very simple and no styling. I hope to build on this site and eventually make it more interactive.</p>
            <p><h2>Work in Progress</h2></p>
            <p>I am currently working on this portfolio. I will also be helping my mom make a website, including a store front. She sells a variety of small collectibles. Check back soon as I update my progress!</p>
            <p><h2>Resume</h2></p>
            <p>You can download my resume <a id="resume" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vVj5lqCzRPxFJ6eLJVCijWyFFbNiOBnS/view?usp=sharing" download>here</a>.</p>
