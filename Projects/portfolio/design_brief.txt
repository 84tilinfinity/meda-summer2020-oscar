Colors for my website

Background: #52364D

A darker purple color was chosen as background. I like purple and I think a dark purple will help maintain visibility of text.

Body Text: #D18AC5

The body text is lighter in order to contrast with the background.

Header Text: #916089

Header text is darker than body, helping identify it as important.

Link Text: #DE92D1

Lighter than the body text, so any viewer can see that it is a link.
