Colors for my website

Background: #52364D
A darker purple color was chosen as background. I like purple and I think a dark purple will help maintain visibility of text.

Body Text: #D18AC5
The body text is lighter in order to contrast with the background.

Header Text: #916089
Header text is darker than body, helping identify it as important.

Link Text: #DE92D1
Lighter than the body text, so any viewer can see that it is a link.

HOME
I have imagined my Home page to be simple and only contain my name and picture, as well as the city I currently reside in and some hobbies. From there, visitors are able to choose where they would like to navigate by clicking on the navigation bar.

ABOUT ME
My Story: Oscar Handabaka was born in Lima, Peru in the Bellavista district of Callao. At the age of 5, he immigrated to the United States with his parents and sister. His parents chose Hayward, CA as their home and Oscar enjoyed growing up in the East Bay Area. After attending San Jose State University and receiving a degree in Sociology, Oscar moved to San Francisco, CA. He currently resides in the Excelsior district with his girlfriend and daughter.

Experience: Oscar has 7 years of customer service experience after managing 2 high volume restaurants in that period of time. He recently worked for Equator Coffees and was on his way to receiving a location to manage in SF before a shelter in place was ordered by the state. As a result, Oscar was laid off and is currently searching for employment.

Goals: Oscar would like to continue as a cafe manager, enabling him to take classes at CCSF to obtain a certificate for web development. Eventually, he would like to earn an entry level position as a developer.

Current Skills: Oscar currently has 7 years of restaurant management experience, including scheduling, inventory count, onboarding new team members, ordering food and supplies, as well as keeping up to date on local labor laws. Oscar has been taking courses on Javascript, CSS and HTML. Mission Techies from MEDA has helped a lot in the learning process.
