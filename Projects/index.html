  <h1>How to make Cold Brew Coffee</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p><h3>About me</h3></p>
  
  <p>Hi, my name is Oscar and I love coffee. Although waking up early can be rough, holding an iced, cold cup of coffee can make mornings a bit smoother. My love for coffee began one warm early morning at a local coffee shop. I worked as a manager of a high volume restaurant in downtown San Francisco and was looking for an alternative to energy drinks. The only option for cold coffee on the menu was Cold Brew. Luckily, it turned out to be the right option. It tasted smooth and contained plenty of caffeine to get me through the morning rush at the restaurant. I've been a fan ever since.</p>

  <p><h3>The Joy of Cold Brew</h3></p>
  <p>The process of making Cold Brew coffee can be therapeutical. It's almost like creating a perfect dish for dinner. Making Cold Brew can be very easy if you choose to buy grounded coffee beans. Even if you grind your own beans at home, it is a relatively quick process with only a few steps to the end goal. Nothing says success like a cold, flavorful, perfectly caffeinated cup of coffee.</p>
