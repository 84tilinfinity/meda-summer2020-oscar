  <h1>How to brew Cold Brew Coffee</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Oscar and I love coffee. Although waking up early can be rough, holding an iced, cold cup of coffee can make mornings a bit smoother. My love for coffee began one warm early morning at a local coffee shop. I worked as a manager of a high volume restaurant and was looking for an alternative to energy drinks. I didn't want a hot drink because it was the middle of summer, cold brew was my only option for black coffee. I asked the barista what made cold brew different than regular iced coffee. The difference was the brewing process, which made cold brew a lot smoother to drink than traditionally brewed coffee. </p>
